# SimonSays

The Simon Says game is a classic children's game that tests players' listening skills and ability to follow instructions
 For example, if Simon says "Simon says touch your nose," players must touch their noses. 
 If Simon simply says "Touch your nose" without prefacing it with "Simon says," players should not follow the command. 
 Anyone who does is out of the game. 

Similarly in this game Simon gives a random colour and user has to folow the pattern to continue the game
